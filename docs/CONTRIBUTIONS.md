## üìù Content Standards

### Educational Quality

**Progressive Learning:**
- Each hint builds on previous knowledge
- Concepts introduced in logical order
- Real-world context always provided
- Clear learning objectives stated

**Technical Accuracy:**
- KQL syntax is current and correct
- Attack patterns reflect real threats
- Detection logic is sound and tested
- False positive rates are minimized

**Engagement:**
- Content is interesting and motivating
- Examples are relevant and current
- Language is clear and accessible
- Visual design supports learning

### Writing Style

**Tone:** Professional but approachable, like a knowledgeable colleague
**Format:** Scannable with headers, bullets, and visual breaks
**Language:** Clear technical explanations without excessive jargon
**Examples:** Always include practical, working code samples

```markdown
# ‚úÖ Good example:
"Password spray attacks target multiple users with a few password attempts each. This differs from brute force attacks that focus on one user with many attempts."

# ‚ùå Avoid:
"Implement detection mechanisms for distributed authentication failure patterns across multiple identity vectors."
```

## üîß Technical Standards

### JavaScript Guidelines

```javascript
// ‚úÖ Good: Clear naming and error handling
async function loadEnhancedChallengeContent(scenarioId) {
    try {
        console.log(`üöÄ Loading enhanced content for: ${scenarioId}`);
        // Implementation with clear logic
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(`‚ùå Failed to load content: ${error}`);
        return fallbackContent; // Always provide fallback
    }
}

// ‚ùå Avoid: Unclear purpose and no error handling
function load(id) {
    return fetch(id).then(r => r.json());
}
```

### CSS Guidelines

```css
/* ‚úÖ Good: BEM methodology, mobile-first */
.challenge-panel {
    padding: 1rem;
    background: var(--bg-color);
}

.challenge-panel__header {
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .challenge-panel {
        padding: 2rem;
    }
}

/* ‚ùå Avoid: Non-descriptive names, desktop-first */
.panel {
    width: 1200px;
    padding: 30px;
}
```

### JSON Content Structure

```json
{
  "progressiveHints": [
    {
      "level": 1,
      "title": "üéØ Clear Action-Oriented Title",
      "content": "Educational explanation that builds understanding progressively.",
      "example": "KQLTable | where realistic_condition"
    }
  ]
