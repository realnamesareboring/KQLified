{
  "step": 3,
  "title": "Focus on Failed Authentication Events",
  "operator": "| where ResultType != 0",
  "explanation": "Filters for authentication failures only. ResultType 0 means success, any other value indicates failure with specific error codes.",
  "detectiveInsight": "Like reviewing only the failed entry attempts in security camera footage - successful logins are normal, but failures reveal attack patterns.",
  "borderColor": "#f44336"
}
```

## 📊 Training Data Standards

### CSV Data Quality

**Realism Requirements:**
- Use authentic field names from actual log sources
- Include realistic IP addresses, usernames, and timestamps
- Mix normal and suspicious activity in believable ratios
- Reflect actual attack timing and patterns

**Data Structure:**
```csv
# ✅ Good example: Realistic Microsoft sign-in logs
TimeGenerated,UserPrincipalName,IPAddress,Location,ResultType,AppDisplayName,ClientAppUsed
2025-06-27T09:15:20Z,alice.johnson@company.com,10.0.1.50,"Seattle, WA",0,Microsoft Teams,Modern Authentication
2025-06-27T13:45:12Z,admin@company.com,203.0.113.45,Unknown,50126,Microsoft 365,Browser

# ❌ Avoid: Generic or unrealistic data
Time,User,IP,Status,App
09:15,user1,1.1.1.1,OK,email
13:45,admin,bad_ip,FAIL,web
```

**Volume Guidelines:**
- **Minimum**: 50 rows for meaningful analysis
- **Optimal**: 100-200 rows for rich pattern detection
- **Pattern ratio**: 80% normal activity, 20% suspicious patterns
- **Attack signature**: Clear but not obvious detection pattern

**Quality checklist:**
- [ ] **Consistent format**: All rows have same column structure
- [ ] **Realistic values**: Field values match actual log formats
- [ ] **Clear patterns**: Attack behavior is detectable but not trivial
- [ ] **Noise included**: Some non-attack anomalies present
- [ ] **Time ordering**: Timestamps follow logical sequence

### KQL Solution Standards

**Solution Quality Framework:**
```kql
// [Challenge Name] Detection
// Brief description of what this detects and why it matters
// Detection confidence: High/Medium/Low
// Expected false positive rate: Low/Medium/High

TableName
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)    // ⏰ Time scope
| where [primary_filter]            // 🎯 Attack filtering
| summarize                         // 📊 Analysis
    [key_metric] = [aggregation],        // Primary detection signal
    [supporting_metric] = [calculation], // Supporting evidence
    [evidence_list] = make_set([field])  // Investigation details
    by [grouping_fields]                 // Attack source grouping
| where [threshold_condition]       // ⚡ Noise reduction
| extend [calculated_field] = [formula] // 🔢 Additional insights
| order by [priority_field] desc    // 📈 Investigation priority
| project [final_columns]           // 📋 Clean output
```

**Technical requirements:**
- [ ] **Syntactically correct**: Query executes without errors
- [ ] **Functionally effective**: Actually detects the attack pattern
- [ ] **Performance conscious**: Reasonable execution time
- [ ] **False positive aware**: Includes noise reduction techniques
- [ ] **Investigation ready**: Provides actionable output for analysts

**Educational requirements:**

- [ ] **Well commented**: Explains each major step
- [ ] **Professional style**: Production-quality formatting
- [ ] **Real-world applicable**: Could be used in actual SOC
- [ ] **Learning focused**: Teaches important detection principles

## ✍️ Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone and Voice

**Professional but approachable**: Like a knowledgeable colleague sharing expertise
**Encouraging and supportive**: Builds confidence rather than intimidation
**Practical and actionable**: Every explanation leads to concrete actions
**Enthusiastic about security**: Conveys passion for threat detection

**Examples:**

✅ **Good tone:**
> "Password spray attacks are tricky because they stay under the radar - just a few attempts per user to avoid account lockouts. Let's use KQL's grouping power to reveal this distributed pattern!"

❌ **Avoid - too academic:**
> "Password spray methodologies represent a distributed authentication attack vector utilizing low-frequency targeting across multiple identity principals to circumvent security policies."

❌ **Avoid - too casual:**
> "These bad guys are super sneaky LOL! They try passwords everywhere but don't want to get caught so they're really careful about it."

### Technical Explanations

**Start with the "why" before the "how":**
```markdown
# ✅ Good approach:
"We need to group failed logins by source IP because password sprays come from single attack sources targeting multiple users. The `summarize` operator does this grouping while letting us count unique targets."

# ❌ Avoid technical-first approach:
"Use `summarize UniqueUsers = dcount(UserPrincipalName) by IPAddress` to aggregate authentication failure events by source network identifier."
```

**Use analogies and metaphors:**
- "Think of KQL like a detective's magnifying glass..."
- "This query acts like a security camera focused on..."
- "Filtering logs is like sifting through evidence..."

**Layer complexity gradually:**
1. Introduce concept with simple explanation
2. Show basic example
3. Add complexity with clear reasoning
4. Connect to broader security context

### Accessibility Standards

**Language clarity:**
- Write at 8th-grade reading level for technical content
- Define all acronyms on first use
- Use active voice over passive voice
- Keep sentences under 20 words when possible

**Visual accessibility:**
- Use consistent heading hierarchy
- Include meaningful emoji sparingly (max 1-2 per hint)
- Ensure adequate color contrast in examples
- Structure content with clear visual breaks

**Learning accessibility:**
- Provide multiple ways to understand concepts
- Include both visual and textual explanations
- Offer different complexity levels
- Support various learning preferences

## 🎯 Scenario Design Standards

### Attack Pattern Authenticity

**Based on real threat intelligence:**
- Reference actual TTPs from MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Include timing patterns from observed attacks
- Use realistic infrastructure and tooling
- Reflect current threat landscape trends

**Scenario validation:**
- [ ] **SOC professional review**: Validated by experienced analysts
- [ ] **Technical accuracy**: Attack mechanics are correct
- [ ] **Detection feasibility**: Pattern is discoverable with KQL
- [ ] **Operational relevance**: Scenario occurs in real environments
- [ ] **Educational value**: Teaches transferable skills

### Difficulty Calibration

**Beginner scenarios:**
- Single attack technique focus
- Clear, unambiguous indicators
- Limited false positives in data
- Straightforward detection logic
- High confidence thresholds

**Advanced scenarios:**
- Multiple attack phases
- Subtle indicators requiring correlation
- Realistic noise and false positives
- Complex detection logic
- Lower confidence, probabilistic indicators

**Testing approach:**
```markdown
1. Expert creates challenge (should be easy for expert)
